## Introduction

This example demonstrates a simple scratch controller using the AS5600 sensor for rotational input (a disc or similar mechanism is recommended) via I2C. It allows direct control over the playback of a selected audio sample for scratching. The example does not require additional RAM, as all samples are stored and played back directly from flash memory, ensuring maximum compatibility.

## Supported Platforms

Currently, only the ESP32 platform is supported. Other platforms may be added in the future.

## Features

-   Sample storage and playback directly from flash memory
-   16-bit audio playback
-   Precise control using the AS5600 sensor

## Future Improvements

-   Support for stereo playback
-   Enhanced audio quality by reducing aliasing
-   Integration of control buttons
-   ADC input as a fader for a better scratching experience
